  <h1>What is this all about?</h1>
</div>

<br>The **ft_irc** project is an implementation of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server designed to simulate the basic functionality of an IRC server used for real-time communication between users in channels. 
Built with C++98, this project aims to create a simple yet functional IRC server that supports essential commands such as `JOIN`, `PART`, `NICK`, `USER`, and more.

The project is split into two versions:

1. **Base Version**: The basic IRC server, where you can connect clients, join channels, send messages, and manage nicknames.
2. **Bonus Version**: An extended version that includes a bot, adding additional functionality and interactivity to the server, allowing users to engage with automated responses or other features.

The goal of this project is not only to provide a working chat system but also to enhance the understanding of network programming, client-server interactions, and socket management in C++. 
It allows users to create channels, join them, send private messages, and manage their own nicknames, all while interacting with other clients on the server.

By building this project, you will learn about handling multiple client connections, managing real-time communication in a server-client model, and dealing with the intricacies of networking protocols.

Whether you're new to networking, C++, or just want to build something practical, this project gives you a hands-on experience with the IRC protocol and lays the foundation for more complex server-client applications.

  <h1>How can I test it?</h1>
</div>
<div align="center">
<p>I'm glad you asked! The process is very simple.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h4>1ยบ Step - Download the files:</h4>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brennm2/IRCServer.git | cd IRCServer
```

<h4>2ยบ Step - Compiling the program</h4>

```bash
make
```
I recommend using bonus version, so:
```bash
make bonus
```
<br>
<h4>3ยบ Step - Running the server!</h4>

Now you need to put in the following inputs:<br>
- ft_irc version (irc_serv or irc_servbonus)<br>
- Port (ex 6667)<br>
- Password (ex 1234)<br>
```bash
./ircserv_bonus 6667 1234
```

<h4>4ยบ Step - Join the Server!</h4>
<p>By Netcat:</p>

```bash
nc -C localhost 6667
pass 1234
user bde-souz
nick brendon 0 * :Brendon Vianna
```

<p>The map can be modified, altered or even created in a simple and functional way, as long as it follows these rules:</p>

```bash
- Only have ONE Player and depending on the letter, which direction will you look when you start the game ([N][S][W][E])
- It has to got a valid RGB value for Floor[F] and Ceiling[C] (No duplicated or invalid RGB value)
- It has to got a valid texture PATH (No duplicated paths or invalid path)
- It has to be enclosed by Walls (1)
- And it needs to be filled with floors (0)
- It can be on any shape, but it HAS to be closed by wall
- The map can only use the following characters: 1, 0, [SPACE], [N,S,W,E] and D -> (D is for Doors only in bonus)
- The map extension must be ".cub"
```
<br>
<br>
<p>Here's a simple example:</p>

```bash
NO assets/sprites/default/north_wall.xpm
SO assets/sprites/default/south_wall.xpm
WE assets/sprites/default/west_wall.xpm
EA assets/sprites/default/east_wall.xpm

F 18,53,25
C 153,204,255
